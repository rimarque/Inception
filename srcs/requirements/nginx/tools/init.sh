# the first line is the shebang tells the system that this script should be executed using Bash shell

# this file script automates the setup and configuration tasks required to prepare the service inside the container; ensures the environment is correctly set up each time the container starts
# by automating the initialization steps, the script ensures the container env is consistent and reproducible accross different deployments
# can read env variables and use them to configure the service, allowing the same container image to be used in multiple environments with different configurations
# this script integrates with the container's CMD instruction to run the main application process after the initialization steps are completed, ensuring that the application starts in a properly configured state

# this line, if uncommented, enables the debug mode, making the script print each command executing it and exit if any of it returns a non-zero status
# set -ex # print commands & exit on error (debug mode)

# Generate the SSL certificate and key: This command generates a self-signed certificate (-x509) valid for 365 days (-days 365), 
# using a new RSA private key (-newkey rsa:2048). The certificate's subject (-subj) is specified with the variables, ensuring it accurately reflects your organization's identity.

# openssl: command-line tool for the OpenSSL library, which provides various cryptographic operations
# req: specifies that we want to use the "certificate request and certificate generating utility" in OpenSSL. This utility can be used to create a certificate signing request (CSR) or, in this case, a self-signed certificate.
# using a self-signed certificate is primarily useful in situations where you need to encrypt data over HTTPS (HTTP Secure) but don't require third-party validation or where setting up a full certificate authority (CA) infrastructure isn't feasible or necessary
# -x509: to generate a self-signed certificate instead of a certificate signing request (CSR); the X.509 standard defines the format of public key certificates.
# -nodes: no DES (Data Encryption Standard): the key will not be encrypted with a passphrase, which is practical for automated scripts.
# -days 365: the validity period of the certificate
# -newkey rsa:2048: generates a new private key using the RSA algorithm with a key size of 2048 bits
# -keyout $certify_path.key: specifies the filename where the private key will be saved.
# -out $certify_path.crt
# -subj "/C=$COUNTRY/ST=$STATE/L=$LOCALITY/O=$ORGANIZATION/OU=$UNIT/CN=$DOMAIN: sets up the details in the certificate
# these components are crucial in certificate validation. When a client (such as a web browser) connects to a server secured with SSL/TLS, it verifies the details in the certificate to ensure it's connecting to the intended server
